display the sample product records in app
display only values of "imageUrl", "productName", "price", "starRating" thorugh a table element, with 4 columns (image, name, price, rating)

1. create a feature module "products" (inside a sub-folder products in app directory)
2. create a component file "product-list" (inside the products/components/product-list folder)
3. register the component with products module

4. also, need facility to filter the product records by "productName"
5. in the product-list component at the top of table create a textbox with a label. the records, displayed below through the table will be filtered by the value (product name) as entered in the text box.

6. product names must be displayed in uppercase and the price of the products should be displayed with INR currency symbol

7. create an alternate template in case there is no product present, which displays "No products available"

8. create a model to represent each product object in a separate file
9. save the sample data in an array (which should be of type product array) in a separate file

Note: product-list will displayed as nested component of app component


enhancement-1:
---------------------------
1. create separate component for filtration (product-filter)
2. create another component (product-container)
3. nest the product-list and product-filter inside product-container
4. make the product-container exportable (remove product-list from exports array)
5. nest product-container inside app component

Note: product-filter should pass text to filter (product name) to product-list via product-container
